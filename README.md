# auto_trendline
This project explores linear regression channels and pivot-based trendlines in Python, with emphasis on price structure, channel geometry, and forward extension.

📈 Price Structure Research – Regression Channels & Trend Geometry

Note: This repository contains visual references only.
Source code is intentionally not included.

Overview

This project explores price-structure geometry using:

Linear regression–based trend estimation

Parallel channel construction (constant slope, shifted intercepts)

Pivot-derived primary and secondary trendlines

Forward extension and regime visualization

Optional logarithmic price scaling

The goal is research and structural understanding of price behavior, not indicator replication or signal generation.

What’s Included

📷 Images / plots showing:

Regression base lines

Multi-level parallel channels

Primary and secondary trendlines

Forward-projected structure

📊 Visual examples across different market regimes and timeframes

What’s Not Included

❌ Source code

❌ Trading signals or strategies

❌ Ready-to-use indicators

This is intentional.

The implementation is part of an ongoing private research framework and is shared selectively.

Methodology (High Level)

A single base trendline is estimated using linear regression

Channels are constructed as parallel offsets (same slope, different intercepts)

Trendlines are derived from validated price pivots, not bar-to-bar fitting

Structure is emphasized over indicators; geometry over heuristics

Intended Use

Visual reference for price-structure analysis

Conceptual understanding of trend/channel geometry

Research discussion and collaboration

Not intended for:

Automated trading

Indicator resale

Plug-and-play strategies
